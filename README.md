# LifeSim - AI Simulated World in Python
This is a fun little project I’m working on to practice Python programming and explore basic AI concepts by simulating a simple agent in a virtual world. It’s a playground for learning how agents interact with environments, manage resources and how to build simulations step-by-step.

## Overview
LifeSim is a simple simulation of an agent living in a 2D grid world. The agent moves randomly around the grid, looking for food to eat and maintain its energy. The simulation demonstrates basic concepts of grid-based environments, agents and simple resource management.

## Features
- A 20x20 grid representing the world.
- Randomly spawned food items ('F') scattered around the grid.
- An agent that moves randomly one step per turn.
- The agent consumes energy each move and gains energy by eating food.
- The simulation stops when the agent runs out of energy.
